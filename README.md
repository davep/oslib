# OSLib

OSLib is a small and simple library that gave the CA-Clipper programmer a
small number of functions for checking what kind of environment their
application is running in. It can check for MS-Windows, NT and OS/2 and it
also contains functions for releasing time slices back to the host OS.

The functions in this library can be found in other libs too, but OSLib was
written at the request of a couple of people in `comp.lang.clipper`. OSLib
was not supposed to replace anything or be better than anything, it was a
small library that people could be pointed to when they asked how they could
detect MS-Windows or OS/2, for example.
